About the program:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a system that procedurally generates game environment.
The environment is geolocalized with biomes and vegetation.
The target devices are mobile phones where the generation is done in real time. 
The generated environment is then tested with real users using a simple game prototype.

The program downloads data from Google Elevation API and for that it needs an API key. 
You can enter your Google API key in the file Settings.cs that can be found here: Assets/Scripts/Common

The user manual can be found in appendix B of the thesis. The thesis can be found here: https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/115009
